## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Welcome to the Spring Boot McDonald's Order Machine project! In this endeavor, we delve into the realm of 
software development using Spring Boot to create a streamlined and efficient ordering system inspired by 
the world-renowned McDonald's.

This project serves as an immersive learning experience, providing a platform to grasp fundamental skills 
in software development. Through the utilization of Spring Boot, a powerful framework for building Java-based 
applications, we aim to craft a functional and user-friendly ordering system.

## RESTful Endpoints <a name="restful_endpoints"></a>
Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used 
for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without
having any processing.

The software industry has adopted several patterns for capturing agreed upon API behavior in documentation and 
code. These agreements are often called "contracts". We define an API contract as a formal agreement between 
a software provider and a consumer that abstractly communicates how to interact with each other. This contract 
defines how API providers and consumers interact, what data exchanges looks like, and how to communicate success 
and failure cases.
