# McDonald's Order Machine

## Introduction

Welcome to the Spring Boot McDonald's Order Machine project! In this endeavor, we delve into the realm of 
software development using Spring Boot to create a streamlined and efficient ordering system inspired by 
the world-renowned McDonald's.

This project serves as an immersive learning experience, providing a platform to grasp fundamental skills 
in software development. Through the utilization of Spring Boot, a powerful framework for building Java-based 
applications, we aim to craft a functional and user-friendly ordering system.
